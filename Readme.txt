#Problem_1

This program reads two arrays of integers, 'tab1' and 'tab2', 
from the user and calculates the sum of elements in 'tab1' that are not common to 'tab2' and vice versa. 
The final result is printed as `sum`.


#Problem_2
The code defines a function 'CalculateDotProduct' that takes two arrays of integers as input 
and returns their dot product.
Then, it uses this function to calculate the dot product of two vectors and determines whether
the vectors are orthogonal based on the dot product result.
